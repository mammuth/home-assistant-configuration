# My Configuration for Home Assistant

Within this repository I'm sharing my Home Assistant configuration.

### Noteworthy stuff
- 22 automations in total
- FRITZ!Box Guest Wifi Control ([custom_component](https://github.com/mammuth/home-assistant-configuration/blob/master/custom_components/fritzbox_guestwifi.py))

- Turn coffee machine on when alarm clock rings (using Sleep As Android and a Wifi switch)
- Turn on bedroom lights 15m before my alarm starts (using Tasker and Sleep As Android)
- Many light automations (Turn on when arriving home, turn off when leaving, dim when TV is turned on, ...)
- Enable shuffle mode on spotify ([shell script](https://github.com/mammuth/home-assistant-configuration/blob/master/shell_commands/shuffle_spotify.sh))
- Voice control with amazon echo and HA via [Haaska](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska)
- WIP: Voice control everything via DIY Amazon Echo (using Dialogflow)


Most of the code / configuration is English except friendly names of frontend-facing entities (which are German).
