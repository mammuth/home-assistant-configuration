This repository contains most parts of my Home Assistant configuration.

### Noteworthy stuff
- 46 automations in total
- FRITZ!Box control and info ([custom_component](https://github.com/mammuth/ha-fritzbox-tools/))
- Fade in lights before the alarm goes of and then start music for a nice start into the day
- Presence-based vacuum robot cleaning schedule
- Voice control of all important things (Alexa / Google Assistant)
- Voice alerts on high air humidity
- Voice announcements after I have changed the air in a room for 5 and 10 minutes
- Many light automations (Turn on when arriving home, turn off when leaving, dim when TV is turned on, ...)
- Motion sensors for some lights (eg. corridors, kitchen ceiling)
- Statistics about media usage (TV-time, App usage (Netflix, Twitch, YouTube, ...)
- Clima statistics for the past 7 days


Most of the code / configuration is English except friendly names of frontend-facing entities (which are German).

### Main Dashboard (minimalistic)

What I love most about our main view is the fact that it includes all fundamental light controls (individuals + scenes) for the important rooms in beautiful picture-cards (the pictures are greyed out when all lights in the room are turned off).
